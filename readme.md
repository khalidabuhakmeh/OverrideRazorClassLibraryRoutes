## Override Razor Class Library Routes

This is a demo project that goes with a blog post on http://khalidabuhakmeh.com showing how to override Razor Pages routes in a Razor Class Library.

The technique can be helpful to folks packaging reusable components to community and want to offer the flexibility of configuring routes.

Cheers :)
